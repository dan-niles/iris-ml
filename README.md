# Machine Learning on the Iris Dataset

This repo contains a simple Python script to perform machine learning on the Iris dataset.

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics. It is included in scikit-learn. The dataset contains 150 samples of three different species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.
